Here's a brief explanation of each directory:

agricultural_education_hub/: This is your main project package. It contains sub-packages and modules for different parts of your project.

cli/: This directory contains the CLI module. The commands.py file can house your CLI command implementations.

database/: This directory is for the database module. models.py contains your SQLAlchemy models, and migrations/ is for Alembic migrations.

utils/: This is where you can place utility functions or modules that might be shared across different parts of your project.

main.py: This is the entry point of your CLI application. It's where you would initialize your CLI and start processing commands.

tests/: This directory is for your unit tests. You can organize your tests based on the modules they are testing.

migrations/: This directory is for Alembic migrations. As you run migrations, Alembic will generate and store them here.

Pipfile and Pipfile.lock: These files are used by Pipenv to manage dependencies and the virtual environment for your project.

alembic.ini: Alembic configuration file. Configure Alembic to use your database connection here.

.gitignore: Git ignore file to specify files and directories that should be ignored by version control.

README.md: Project documentation. This is where you can provide information on how to set up and run your project.

requirements.txt: If there are additional dependencies that are not managed by Pipenv, you can list them here.
